VBA HW Nicolas Tacos 
The first thing I did was Dim all of my variables
Then, I started a For Loop so it would repeat on each sheet
Next, I filled in all of the headers
Then, I Set the value of the row to 2 so it could be added onto later
Then, I created a for loop to read through all of the data
then, I created an if statement to separate the different ticker names, which would allow me to separate the data
then, with the data I filled the ticker name, the volume value
then i used the open and close data to figure out yearly and percent change
then all of these pieces of data were put into cells
and the loop was ended
now i made another for loop to change the colors of the cells based on if they were greater than or less than 0
and then i ended that loop and the ws loop as well
